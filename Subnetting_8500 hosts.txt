IpV4 Addressing scheme

C - onvert to bits 
S - ubtract from /32
I - insert int the location

Given:
Accenture
10.0.0.0/8 having 8500 Hosts

C = 8500 is 14 bits
S = /32 - /14 = /18
I = /18 is under 3rd Octet (3rd, 64i) 
Accenture network is between 10.0.64.0/18 + 1 and 10.0.64+64.0/18-1
Therefore:  10.0.64.1 to 10.0.127.254 is for 8500 Hosts

Design Implementation, D1, A1, P1

D1 - DHCP Server
conf t
int vlan 10
	name accenture
	exit
int vlan 10
	no shut
	ip add 10.0.64.1 255.255.255.192
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.0.64.1 10.0.64.100 
!we dont give the first Hundred IPs
ip dhcp pool accenture.com
	network 10.0.64.0 255.255.192.0
	default-router 10.0.61.1
	domain accenture.com
	ip name-server 8.8.8.8
	
end


A1: Put port connecting the P1 from A1 to Vlan 10 (E0/0)
conf t
do sho vlan brief
int e0/0
	switchport mode access
	switchport access vlan 10
end
show vlan brief


P1:
conf t
int e0/0
ip add dhcp
no shut
do sho ip int brie
exit
